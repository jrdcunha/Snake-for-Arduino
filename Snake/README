Game Description:
	This an adaptation of the classic Snake game. The player will control the
	direction of a continuously moving snake. One “item”  will appear on the
	screen at any given time, and the player will gain points by “consuming”
	items with the snake. When an item is consumed, another one will appear
	somewhere else on the screen. However, every time an item is consumed, the
	snake grows in length thus increasing the difficulty. The player loses if
	the snake touches the boundary of the screen or if the head of the snake
	comes in contact with the rest of its body.
